# System and Network Security Hardening based on CIS Benchmarks and ISO 27001 Standards

## Overview
This repository contains security hardening guides and checklists for **Windows** and **Ubuntu** systems, implemented following **CIS Benchmarks** and **ISO 27001 standards**. The goal is to minimize attack surfaces, enforce least privilege, and ensure compliance with industry security frameworks.

## Contents
- **Windows_Hardening**: Configuration steps, scripts, and checklists for Windows system hardening.
- **Ubuntu_Hardening**: Security configurations, scripts, and checklists for Ubuntu Linux hardening.
- **Checklists**: Comprehensive tables mapping applied hardening steps to CIS and ISO 27001 controls.
- **Theory**: Explanation of each hardening step and its relevance to security frameworks.

## Features
- System hardening aligned with **CIS Level 1 & 2 Benchmarks**
- ISO 27001 compliance mapping (Annex A controls: A.5 â€“ A.18)
- Security configurations for:
  - User and permission management
